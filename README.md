About Me
I am a person with high learning ability and enthusiasm, I love programming and innovation. All this made me go to the software engineering field in the university and I am also interested in doing research work in my field in order to develop products and ideas. Besides these, working as a team and project has many attractions for me. I have always sought to increase my knowledge and skills in the field of programming.
